CSUMB CST205 Final Project Group 13 (Members: Julio Aguirre, Ras Hipolito, David Duong) Magic Camera 
Our project, Magic Camera, opens the user’s camera and shows everything normally except with one twist! It makes the colors blue and red invisible! Of course, you can’t just see through an object for example covering the camera in a red piece of paper, but it saves the last seen image before it sees that color and displays it over that color.
